RNG
===

This program is a random number generator that uses the random number generation algorithm
"Real Version 2" from the paper "Random Numbers: Good Ones are Hard to Find" by Park and Miller.
The "Real Version 2" algorithm in the paper on page 3 is presented in Pascal code. In essence this
program is the C++ version of "Real Version 2" algorithm written originally in Pascal.
